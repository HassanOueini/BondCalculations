# BondCalculations
# Abstract
Bonds are debt obligations that a company, government, or instituation can issue for funding a project or to help with their financing. The way to price bonds is by discounting the coupon payments and any future payments you might receive. However this does not account for things such as duration and convexity. Duration measures how much a bondâ€™s price will change when interest rates change. If a bond has a duration of 5, its price will drop about 5% if interest rates go up by 1%. If rates go down by 1%, its price will rise by 5%. Meanwhile convexity measures how the rate of price change (from duration) itself changes as interest rates move. If interest rates move a lot, convexity helps adjust the duration estimate, showing that price changes might be smaller or larger than expected. This project allows user to find the price, duration and convexity of bonds.
